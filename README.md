Best adhesive & glue manufacturer in China, our adhesives are widely used in consumer electronic, home appliance, smart phone, laptop and more industries. our R&D team customizes glue products for customers to help customers reduce costs and improve process quality. Glue products are delivered quickly and ensure their environmental friendliness and performance.

Deep Material red glue has been tested at 48000/H high-speed dispensing, so you have no worries. Avoid false welding or even direct scrapping of the product after the parts are patched due to the quality of the red plastic wire drawing.

The capillary speed is fast, and the filling degree is more than 95%, which is suitable for high-speed glue spraying. Solve the problem that the filling of the product is not full, the glue does not penetrate, and the bottom is not filled.

Complete curing as fast as 3 minutes, suitable for fully automated mass production, high efficiency, while greatly reducing costs! Solve the problems of too long curing time, low work efficiency and prolonged work cycle.

High and low temperature resistance -50~125â„ƒ, deformation resistance, bending resistance, dispersion reduces the stress on the solder balls, and reduces the CTE difference between the chip and the substrate. Solve the problems of fragility, no falling, poor product quality, waste and other problems.

The capillary speed is fast, and the filling degree is more than 95%, which is suitable for high-speed glue spraying. Solve the problem that the filling of the product is not full, the glue does not penetrate, and the bottom is not filled.

The product has passed the SGS certification and obtained the RoHS/HF/REACH/7P test report.
[Deep Material Japan](https://deepmaterialjp.com/) conducts in-depth research on the application scenarios and characteristics of customers' adhesives, combined with customer needs, the professional R&D team customizes high-performance products and overall solutions that are not limited to the needs, so that adhesive products are more suitable for customers' practical applications and help customers improve their processes. Quality, reduce cost consumption, and achieve fast delivery.
